## TODO:
1. Use "g1_gwt_optimized" function to calculate and pass G1 and GWT for w_subset into python.
2. Check if solutions are as correct as before.
3. Improve the trace calculation of f_listed in .py
4. IF     time_gain = TRUE, send saptarshi da and continue simulations
   ELSE   improve the get_g1 and get_gwt functions in .py following "g1_gwt_optimized".
